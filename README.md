# ETCH-A-SKETCH

This is my attempt of remaking the game etch-a-sketch for The Odin Project. I've learned the following:

- Learned how to use grid
- DOM manipulation
- Working with global variables in CSS
- Setting properties to global variables
- Making sites responsive

How to play?

- Hover in the middle of your screen with your cursor to paint the grid
- Select rainbow mode to use random colors (RGB)
- Erase resets the grid color after hovering over it
- Bottom right circle button is used to reload/reset the grid
- Bottom left circle button is used to customize your grid (up to 100x100)

Have fun! :)
