# ETCH-A-SKETCH

This is my attempt of remaking the classic etch-a-sketch for The Odin Project. I've learned the following:

- Learned how to use grid
- DOM manipulation
- Working with global variables in css
- Setting properties to global variables
- Making sites responsive

# INSTRUCTIONS

- How to play:
Hover in the middle over the screen with your cursor to change the background color.
Select rainbow mode to use random colors.
Erase gives you the option to remove single squares and reset them to the base color.
Bottom right circle button is used to reload/reset the grid.
Bottom left circle button is used to customize your grid (up to 100x100).

Have fun! :)
